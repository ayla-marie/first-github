# first-github
My first project on GitHub. As a newbie programmer, this is going to be basic.

Thanks to Youtube Video Git FLow Part 1 by Reval GOvender, I am begining to understand how Git Hub works beyond just typing up README page edits. I have created a Development Branch, a README_Edits Branch, and a branch for one topic of my coding homework to store my progress in. This should make sharing what I am doing much easier than copying code from the Eclipse IDE and pasting it into a chat-room note.
